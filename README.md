## Current Users Logging Script Documentation

### Purpose:
The purpose of this script is to log information about currently logged-in users to a specified log file. The script retrieves the output of the `who` command, extracts relevant details (username, terminal, login date, and login time), and appends this information to a log file. The log file includes a timestamp indicating when the logging started.
